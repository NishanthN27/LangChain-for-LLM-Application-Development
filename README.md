# LangChain for LLM Application Development

Programs I executed while I completed **DeepLearning.AI's LangChain for LLM Application Development** course by Harrison Chase and Andrew Ng that covered:

- **Models, Prompts and Parsers**  
    calling LLMs, providing prompts and parsing the response

- **Memories for LLMs**  
    memories to store conversations and manage limited context space

- **Chains**  
    creating sequences of operations

- **Question Answering over Documents**  
    apply LLMs to your proprietary data and use case requirements

- **Agents**  
    explore the powerful emerging development of LLM as reasoning agents
